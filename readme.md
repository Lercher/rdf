# RDF tools

This is an exploration project. I doubt that it will ever reach production quality.

It consists of the following packages:

## package graph

Basic rdf datatypes and triples

## package algebra

Query algebra resulting from a parsed SPARQL statement

## package processor

Engine to execute an algebra instance on a graph

## package sparql

parsing SPARQL syntax to form an algebra instance

## Get and Build the Code

Download

## Modifing the *.g4 Grammars

* have a JRE installed
* use Visual Studio Code
* install this [antlr4 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mike-lischke.vscode-antlr4)

Then use this VSCode settings as provided in [settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) in this repository to have the lexer, parser and listeners generated by the extension:

````json
"antlr4.generation": {
    "mode": "external",
    "language": "Go",
    "listeners": true,
    "visitors": false,
    "outputDir": "parser"
},
````

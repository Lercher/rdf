# RDF tools

This is an exploration project. I doubt that it will ever reach production quality.

It consists of the following packages:

## package graph

Basic rdf datatypes and triples

## package algebra

Query algebra resulting from a parsed SPARQL statement

## package processor

Engine to execute an algebra instance on a graph

## package sparql

parsing SPARQL syntax to form an algebra instance

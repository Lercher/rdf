# RDF tools

This is an exploration project on RAM based virtualized graph databases written in Go (golang). I doubt that it will ever reach production quality.

## Get and Build the Code

Assuming the go SDK is installed already, download

````bat
go get github.com/lercher/rdf
````

### Build

````bat
go get
go build
````

### Test

````bat
go test ./...
````

or

````bat
go test ./... -short
````

## Deployment and Runtime Requirements

There are no particular runtime requirements, just copy the executable and run it with
appropriate command line parameters. Go supports a lot of environments out of the box
and so does this project.

## Development Tasks

### Modifing *.g4 Grammars

First of all: don't do it. The generated artefacts of the antlr4 run are included in the repository,
ready to be compiled by go. But in case you really need to do it:

* install a current JRE
* install and use Visual Studio Code
* install this [antlr4 VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mike-lischke.vscode-antlr4)

Then use these VSCode settings as provided in [settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) in this repository to have the lexer, parser and listeners generated by the extension:

````json
"antlr4.generation": {
    "mode": "external",
    "language": "Go",
    "listeners": true,
    "visitors": false,
    "outputDir": "parser"
},
````

## Packages

It consists of the following packages:

### package algebra

Query algebra resulting from a parsed SPARQL statement

### package encoding/binary

Binary reading and writing of Graphs

### package encoding/csv

Import of a csv reader with a header line and subject in the first column to a Graph

### package graph

Basic rdf graph datatypes such as Graph, Triple, TriplePattern and Value

### package processor

Engine to execute an algebra instance on a graph

### package sparql

Parsing SPARQL syntax to form an algebra instance
